# Player Combat Architecture

This document describes the design, components, network authority, data contracts, and simulation mechanics of the Player Combat System in Project Grimhold.

## Architectural Overview

The combat system is built on a modular, strategy-based architecture designed to support deterministic and authoritative multiplayer combat using **Photon Fusion 2.1** in Host/Client mode. It separates:
1. Input capture and transport.
2. Network boundaries and state tracking.
3. Attack execution strategies (Melee and Ranged).
4. Projectile spawning and physical simulation.
5. Entity registration and collision resolution.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Contracts and Interface Definitions (`IAttack`)
All combat behaviors implement the common strategy contract:
* **`IAttack`**: Interface defining the execution strategy for any weapon/ability.
  * `AttackType Type { get; }` (Melee, Ranged, etc.)
  * `float CooldownSeconds { get; }`
  * `AttackInputMode InputMode { get; }` (Press or Hold)
  * `AttackResult Execute(in AttackRequest request)`
* **`AttackRequest`**: Encapsulates attacker context:
  * `EntityId AttackerId` (resolved from `CharacterBase`)
  * `Vector2 Origin`: The world-space attack origin provided by the character combat controller. For ranged attacks, the final projectile origin may include the configured spawn offset.
  * `Vector2 Direction` (normalized shoot direction)
  * `int SimulationTick` (the exact Fusion tick of execution)
* **`AttackResult`**: Captures execution success or detailed failure reasons (Cooldown, MissingConfiguration, InvalidDirection).

### 2. Network Controller (`PlayerCombatNetworkController`)
Serves as the network boundary for character combat:
* Extends `NetworkBehaviour` and processes combat input during Fusion simulation ticks.
* Only State Authority validates and executes attacks.
* Listens to player input commands (e.g., `PrimaryAttack` button and `AimWorldPosition`).
* Synchronizes `AttackSequence` using a `[Networked]` state variable to ensure clients replicate visual presentation smoothly.
* Handles combat cooldowns authoritatively via network tick timers (`TickTimer`).
* Delegates the actual attack execution to the currently active strategy component (`IAttack`).

### 3. Melee Attack Strategy (`MeleeAttack` & `MeleeAttackConfig`)
Executes instant damage detection in a localized area:
* Reads static data parameters from `MeleeAttackConfig` (ScriptableObject).
* Delegates short-range target detection to `IAttackTargetQuery` using the settings defined by `MeleeAttackConfig`.
* Passes damage requests directly to the centralized `IDamageResolver`.

### 4. Ranged Attack Strategy (`RangedAttack` & `RangedAttackConfig`)
Generates physical projectiles that traverse the world:
* Reads static parameters (speed, range, lifetime, layers, prefabs) from `RangedAttackConfig` (ScriptableObject).
* Integrates a configurable **`ProjectileSpawnOffset`**, configured according to the combined collision bounds of the shooter and projectile, which offsets the initial projectile spawn coordinate in the direction of the aim vector to clear the shooter's own collider bounds.
* Delegates spawning requests to an `IProjectileSpawner` instance.

### 5. Projectile Simulation (`NetworkProjectile`)
Represents a networked projectile whose gameplay simulation is executed exclusively by State Authority.
* **Authority-only simulation**: Movement, collision queries, damage resolution, range validation, lifetime expiration, and despawn decisions occur only on State Authority. Proxy instances receive replicated state for presentation.
* **Kinematic movement**: Uses a kinematic `Rigidbody2D` and advances using `Runner.DeltaTime`, avoiding non-authoritative collision responses or forces.
* **Continuous collision detection**: Casts the projectile's collider across the requested tick displacement so targets cannot be skipped between ticks.
* **Physical initialization**: Aligns the Rigidbody2D, Transform, and networked spawn position before the first authoritative simulation step.
* **Physics synchronization**: When required by manually updated transforms, synchronizes the Unity 2D physics state before performing the collider cast.
* **Owner filtering**: Resolves hit colliders through `EntityRegistry` and ignores every collider associated with the projectile owner while continuing to evaluate subsequent hits.
* **Single-impact guarantee**: Consumes an accepted impact before applying damage or requesting despawn, preventing duplicated damage across subsequent ticks or multiple overlapping cast results.
* **Range and lifetime**: Tracks the exact traveled distance and a network `TickTimer`. The final movement step is clamped so the projectile never exceeds its configured maximum range.
* **Obstacle behavior**: A collider without a registered damageable entity still blocks and despawns the projectile but does not produce a damage request. A wall blocks/despawns the projectile without damage.
* **Collision volume**: The projectile prefab defines a gameplay collider whose effective world-space size is independent from unintended visual scaling. The current implementation validates or adjusts the CircleCollider2D radius during initialization to prevent prefab scale from producing an oversized world-space collision volume.

### 6. Entity Identity (`EntityRegistry`)
A fast-lookup database mapping physical colliders (`Collider2D`) to gameplay entity identities (`EntityId`) and damageable contracts (`IDamageable`):
* Allows the projectile simulation to instantly identify targets without expensive `GetComponent` searches.
* Enables precise owner filtering by checking `BelongsToOwner(Collider2D)`, ensuring a projectile never collides with its shooter or any of its child-objects, while allowing impacts against other players/enemies.

## Combat Configuration

Gameplay properties are separated into stable configurations and dynamic network state:

### 1. `MeleeAttackConfig` (ScriptableObject)
Inherits from `AttackConfig`. Validated fields:
* **`_damage`** (float, Min: 0.0): The base damage applied on hit.
* **`_damageType`** (DamageType): Physical, Magical, etc.
* **`_cooldownSeconds`** (float, Min: 0.0): Minimum seconds between attacks.
* **`_inputMode`** (AttackInputMode): Press or Hold.
* **`_range`** (float, Min: 0.1): Spatial offset of the detection circle's center from the attacker origin.
* **`_radius`** (float, Min: 0.1): Detection circle radius.
* **`_maximumTargets`** (int, Min: 1): Maximum number of targets hit in one execute.
* **`_targetLayerMask`** (LayerMask): Layer mask defining which objects are queried.

### 2. `RangedAttackConfig` (ScriptableObject)
Inherits from `AttackConfig`. Validated fields:
* **`_damage`** (float, Min: 0.0): The base damage applied on hit.
* **`_damageType`** (DamageType): Damage type.
* **`_cooldownSeconds`** (float, Min: 0.0): Cooldown between shots.

## Melee Attack Flow

1. **Input Collection**: `PlayerInputReader` latches primary attack input.
2. **Transport**: `PlayerNetworkInput` transports buttons to `FixedUpdateNetwork` via Fusion.
3. **Trigger**: `PlayerCombatNetworkController` processes input. On press/hold, it validates `AttackCooldown` (TickTimer) and character alive state.
4. **Execution**: If authorized and ready, calls `MeleeAttack.Execute(in AttackRequest)`.
5. **Direction**: The attack direction is determined by `PlayerMovementNetworkController.FacingDirection`.
6. **Query Targets**: `MeleeAttack` delegates queries to `Physics2DAttackTargetQuery.FindTargets()`.
   * Center is computed as: `Origin + FacingDirection * Range`.
   * Targets are queried within `Radius` using `Physics2D.OverlapCircle` with a non-allocating buffer.
7. **Deduplication and Exclusion**:
   * Attacker's own `EntityId` is excluded.
   * Targets not registered in the `EntityRegistry`, dead, or invulnerable are ignored.
   * Overlapping colliders belonging to the same entity are deduplicated (preserving only the closest hit point).
8. **Damage Request**: For each candidate target up to `MaximumTargets` (sorted by distance), a `DamageRequest` is built and passed to `IDamageResolver.Resolve()`.

---

## Ranged Attack Flow

1. **Input Collection**: `PlayerInputReader` reads primary attack button and mouse world position `AimWorldPosition`.
2. **Trigger**: `PlayerCombatNetworkController` evaluates the input.
   * If aiming too close to the origin, it defaults the shoot direction to `FacingDirection`.
3. **Execution**: If ready, calls `RangedAttack.Execute(in AttackRequest)`.
4. **Build Request**: `RangedAttack` calculates origin using `SpawnOffset` along the normalized direction and builds `ProjectileSpawnRequest`.
5. **Spawn**: `RangedAttack` calls `IProjectileSpawner.Spawn()`.
6. **Spawner Validation**: `FusionProjectileSpawner` runs only under State Authority. It validates its configs and executes `Runner.TrySpawn()`.
7. **Pre-initialization**: In the `onBeforeSpawned` callback of `TrySpawn`, `NetworkProjectile.InitializeNetworkState()` is invoked to setup the networked variables before replication.
8. **Kinematic Simulation**: `NetworkProjectile` updates in `FixedUpdateNetwork`:
   * Checks `LifetimeTimer` expiration.
   * Moves transform and Rigidbody2D based on `Direction * Speed * DeltaTime`.
   * Clamps final step if remaining range is exceeded.
9. **Collision Casting**: Casts the projectile collider shape along its displacement vector (`Collider2D.Cast`) using `ImpactLayerMask`.
10. **Target/Obstacle Resolution**:
    * Hits are queried against `EntityRegistry`.
    * Projectile owner colliders are ignored.
    * If a valid damageable hit is found under State Authority:
      * Projectile is aligned to the hit contact point.
      * `ImpactConsumed` is set to `true` (guaranteeing one-time damage).
      * `DamageRequest` is dispatched to `IDamageResolver`.
      * Spawner despawns the projectile via `Runner.Despawn()`.
    * If a blocking obstacle (wall) is hit, the projectile despawns without damage.

## Damage Pipeline

```text
DamageRequest ──► IDamageResolver ──► IDamageable (ApplyDamage) ──► DamageResult
```

### 1. `DamageRequest` & `DamageResult`
* **`DamageRequest`**: A plain C# struct transporting attacker ID, target ID, base damage amount, damage type, direction, hit point, and execution tick.
* **`DamageResult`**: Communicates target ID, execution success, damage amount applied, remaining health, fatal flag, and detailed failure reason.

### 2. `DamageResolver`
A network component that validates damage rules:
* Prevents self-damage: returns `SelfDamageRejected` if target ID matches attacker ID.
* Queries target `IDamageable` from the `EntityRegistry`.
* Excludes targets that cannot receive damage or are dead.
* Calls `IDamageable.ApplyDamage()` on the target.

### 3. Entity Registration (`EntityRegistry` & `CharacterBase`)
* Any damageable character must inherit from `CharacterBase` (which implements `IDamageable` and `ICharacter`).
* On `Spawned()`, characters retrieve the runner's `EntityRegistry` and invoke `TryRegister()`, mapping their unique `EntityId` to the `IDamageable` instance and mapping all child `Collider2D` components to the `EntityId`.
* On `Despawned()`, they call `Unregister()` to remove these references.
* This ensures that multiple colliders representing a single character map to the exact same `EntityId`, preventing duplicate target selection or double-damage evaluations in a single query.

Non-character world targets may register the same contracts without inheriting
`CharacterBase`. `BreakableObject` registers its Character-layer damage hitbox
and WorldCollision blocker under one `EntityId`, accepts the ordinary
`DamageRequest` pipeline, and removes both mappings after its authoritative
destruction. See `Docs/Architecture/BreakableLootArchitecture.md`.

## Combat Presentation & Character Defeat Cycle

The combat system coordinates gameplay state with the visual presentation layer through decoupled events and synchronized networked variables. This ensures visual changes have zero impact on the simulation's determinism.

### 1. Damage Feedback Visuals
When a character takes damage (authoritatively confirmed by `Health` changes on State Authority):
* Presentation components (`PlayerDamagePresenter`) trigger procedural feedback.
* **Sprite Flash**: Temporarily overrides the character's material colors to a bright flash color to signify a hit.
* **Scale Pulse**: Briefly scales the character's transform down/up to provide physical impact feedback.
* These reactions run completely client-side in the presentation loop (`Render` or via network property changed callbacks).

### 2. Player Defeat and Visual Hiding
When player health drops to or below zero, a strict death/defeat pipeline is executed:
* **Gameplay Simulation Disabling**: 
  * The character's alive status (`IsAlive = false`) immediately disables movement input and combat actions in `FixedUpdateNetwork`.
  * Ongoing attack timers and active projectile spawns are halted.
* **Presentation Transition**:
  * Visual presentation components (`PlayerDefeatPresenter`, `PlayerAnimatorView`) detect the transition to the dead state.
  * **Immediate Action Hiding**: Combat visual effects, attack animations, and movement indicators are stopped immediately (visual priority: Defeat > Damage Feedback > Attack > Locomotion).
  * **Procedural Hiding Delay**: The player's physical representation (sprite renderers, shadows, visual parts) remains visible in a defeated pose for a configurable delay. After the delay, the visuals are faded out or hidden completely.
  * Gameplay components (such as `NetworkObject`, health variables, colliders, and network controllers) remain active to support the multiplayer session lifecycle.
* **Remote Proxy Synchronization**:
  * Proxies track health transitions and reproduce the defeat pose and fadeout sequence procedurally, guaranteeing visual consistency across all peers.

## Known Limitations and Technical Debt

* **Layer Configuration Dependency**: The system requires strict layer separation. If targets or obstacles are not on the correct layers specified in `MeleeAttackConfig` and `RangedAttackConfig`, collision queries will fail to report hits.
* **Component Casting**: Strategies (`MeleeAttack` and `RangedAttack`) rely on `MonoBehaviour` fields cast to interface references at runtime, which requires careful assignment in the Inspector. Missing component assignments on the prefab will lead to validation errors.

---

## Manual Validation Guide

For thorough multi-peer validation, configure two instances (Host and Client) and follow these steps:

### 1. Melee Combat Test
* **Setup**: Place an Enemy Melee prefab within the scene. Spawn a Player character.
* **Action**: Execute a melee attack while facing the Enemy.
* **Expected Result**: The combat controller triggers target search. Enemy takes damage as shown in host simulation logs. Local gizmo outline correctly overlaps target.

### 2. Ranged Projectile Combat Test
* **Setup**: Deploy Player and Enemy.
* **Action**: Perform ranged attack targeting the Enemy.
* **Expected Result**: Projectile spawns at configured offset. It travels at defined speed, detects the Enemy collider, inflicts damage, and despawns immediately on impact. Projectile is visible on both Host and Client viewports.

### 3. Obstacle Collision Test
* **Setup**: Place a wall obstacle (with static collider) on the impact layer.
* **Action**: Fire a projectile directly at the wall.
* **Expected Result**: Projectile travels and despawns instantly on wall contact. No damage request is generated.

### 4. Range & Lifetime Expiration Test
* **Setup**: Fire a projectile into open space.
* **Action**: Observe projectile travel.
* **Expected Result**: Projectile despawns automatically when either travel distance exceeds `MaxRange` or duration exceeds `LifetimeSeconds`.

### 5. Client Authority Verification
* **Setup**: Launch Client instance.
* **Action**: Force Client to trigger `IProjectileSpawner.Spawn` directly.
* **Expected Result**: Spawner rejects command immediately due to missing `HasStateAuthority` validation check.
