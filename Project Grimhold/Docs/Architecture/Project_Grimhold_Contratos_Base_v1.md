## 1. Purpose

This document is the reference for public gameplay contracts shared across Project Grimhold systems. It records the meaning and ownership of those contracts without duplicating implementation details from concrete components.

The current C# declarations are the source of truth for exact signatures. System-specific behavior belongs in the corresponding architecture document:

- [`PlayerCombatArchitecture.md`](PlayerCombatArchitecture.md)
- [`PlayerInteractionArchitecture.md`](PlayerInteractionArchitecture.md)
- [`LootInteractionArchitecture.md`](LootInteractionArchitecture.md)

## 2. Contract principles

- Requests, results, identifiers, targets, and presentation payloads are immutable value types.
- Core contracts depend on domain identifiers and values, not concrete player, enemy, UI, or Fusion types.
- Input Authority expresses intent. State Authority validates and commits authoritative gameplay changes.
- Presentation observes confirmed results or replicated state and never decides gameplay outcomes.
- Network representation errors are translated or diagnosed at integration boundaries; they are not exposed as domain-specific Fusion failures.
- Public results use typed failure reasons. Exceptions indicate programmer or integration contract violations, not normal gameplay rejection.
- Capabilities are segregated so an entity implements only the operations it actually supports.

## 3. Identity and entity capabilities

### `EntityId`

`EntityId` is an immutable, comparable wrapper around an integer. It identifies an entity independently from a concrete `GameObject`, `NetworkObject`, player, or enemy type.

`default(EntityId)`, whose value is zero, represents an invalid or absent identity where request validity requires a real endpoint.

### `IEntity`

```csharp
public interface IEntity
{
    EntityId Id { get; }
}
```

All entity capabilities derive from `IEntity` when their operation is associated with a registered gameplay entity.

### `ICharacter` and `IPickup`

- `ICharacter : IEntity` exposes whether an entity is alive.
- `IPickup : IInteractable` marks an interactable as a pickup without adding unrelated inventory behavior.

### Entity resolution

`EntityRegistry` is runner-scoped infrastructure that maps an `EntityId` to the capabilities registered for that entity. It prevents combat, interaction, and loot code from depending on concrete prefab classes.

Registration does not grant network authority. The authoritative caller must still validate State Authority before changing gameplay state.

## 4. Combat contracts

### Attack execution

`IAttack` represents an attack strategy:

```csharp
public interface IAttack
{
    AttackType Type { get; }
    float CooldownSeconds { get; }
    AttackInputMode InputMode { get; }
    AttackResult Execute(in AttackRequest request);
}
```

`AttackRequest` contains runtime intent only:

- `AttackerId`
- `Origin`
- normalized `Direction`, or zero when no direction was supplied
- `SimulationTick`

Range, damage, cooldown, projectile speed, and other balance rules belong to attack configuration or the selected strategy rather than the request.

`AttackResult` reports whether execution occurred and, when rejected, an `AttackFailureReason`. A successful attack execution does not imply that damage was applied. In particular, a ranged attack may succeed by spawning a projectile whose impact is resolved later.

### Target queries

`IAttackTargetQuery.FindTargets(in AttackTargetQuery)` isolates spatial detection from attack strategies. The query carries attacker identity, origin, normalized direction, range, radius, maximum targets, and layer mask. Each `AttackTarget` contains only the resolved `TargetId` and hit point.

Implementations must exclude invalid targets, deduplicate entities that own multiple colliders, and honor the requested maximum count. Target queries detect candidates; they do not apply damage.

### Projectile spawning

`IProjectileSpawner.Spawn(in ProjectileSpawnRequest)` isolates core attack logic from Fusion spawning infrastructure.

The immutable request contains owner identity, origin, normalized direction, damage data, speed, lifetime, maximum range, and simulation tick. `ProjectileSpawnResult` reports whether the projectile was spawned.

Only State Authority may perform the authoritative network spawn. A spawned projectile owns later movement and impact timing; the attack does not apply ranged damage immediately.

## 5. Damage contracts

### `DamageRequest`

`DamageRequest` describes one immutable damage attempt:

- attacker and target identities
- requested amount and `DamageType`
- direction and hit point
- simulation tick

### `IDamageResolver`

```csharp
public interface IDamageResolver
{
    DamageResult Resolve(in DamageRequest request);
}
```

The resolver validates authority and request data, resolves the target capability, applies shared rules such as self-damage policy, and delegates final health ownership to `IDamageable`.

### `IDamageable`

```csharp
public interface IDamageable : IEntity
{
    bool CanReceiveDamage { get; }
    DamageResult ApplyDamage(in DamageRequest request);
}
```

The damageable entity owns health, mitigation, death, and the final applied amount. Attacks and projectiles must not modify health directly.

`DamageResult` contains target identity, whether damage was applied, applied damage, remaining health, fatal state, and a typed `DamageFailureReason`.

## 6. Interaction contracts

### Request and target discovery

`InteractionRequest` contains `InteractorId`, `TargetId`, and `SimulationTick`.

`IInteractionTargetQuery.FindTargets(in InteractionTargetQuery)` finds candidates using the interactor identity, origin, maximum distance, and layer mask. Each `InteractionTarget` contains a target identity, closest point, and measured distance.

Target queries discover and order candidates. They do not execute interactions.

### `IInteractable`

```csharp
public interface IInteractable : IEntity
{
    bool CanInteract(in InteractionRequest request);
    InteractionResult Interact(in InteractionRequest request);
}
```

`CanInteract` is a lightweight eligibility query used during selection. `Interact` remains the authoritative operation and returns the final interaction outcome. Callers must not infer authority or guaranteed success from `CanInteract` alone.

### `InteractionResult`

`InteractionResult` is the general result of interacting with a world entity. It records:

- `Success`
- whether the target was consumed
- `InteractionFailureReason`

The result intentionally does not expose every subsystem-specific reason. An interactable translates its detailed domain outcome to the stable interaction vocabulary.

For loot pickups:

- `MissingAuthority` maps to `MissingStateAuthority`.
- `DestinationNotFound` maps to `ReceiverNotFound`.
- `OutOfRange` maps to `OutOfRange`.
- Other loot rejections map to `LootRejected`.

## 7. Loot value objects

### `LootId`

`LootId` is a small immutable identifier compared with ordinal string semantics. `IsValid` is derived from a non-empty, non-whitespace value.

The public constructor rejects an invalid textual ID because constructing a configured loot identity is a programming or configuration boundary. `default(LootId)` remains representable so requests and entries can expose derived validity and be tested safely.

### `LootEntry`

`LootEntry` is the only canonical aggregated loot stack. It contains exclusively:

- `LootId`
- `Amount`
- derived `IsValid`
- value equality and a consistent hash code

The constructor preserves supplied values, including invalid quantities, so validation remains explicit at system boundaries. An entry is valid only when its loot ID is valid and its amount is positive.

There is no parallel `LootStack` type.

## 8. Unified loot transfer model

### `LootTransferRequest`

`LootTransferRequest` is an immutable request to move one complete quantity between two entities:

```csharp
public readonly struct LootTransferRequest
{
    public EntityId SourceId { get; }
    public EntityId DestinationId { get; }
    public LootId LootId { get; }
    public int RequestedAmount { get; }
    public int SimulationTick { get; }
    public bool IsValid { get; }
}
```

Validity requires non-default source and destination identities, a valid loot ID, and a positive requested amount. The simulation tick is preserved without imposing an additional validity rule.

The constructor preserves invalid gameplay data instead of throwing, allowing endpoints to return typed rejection reasons.

### `LootTransferResult`

`LootTransferResult` represents either complete success or complete rejection:

- `Succeeded(request)` accepts only a valid request and copies its complete `RequestedAmount`.
- `Rejected(reason)` accepts only a defined failure reason and records zero transferred quantity.
- `default(LootTransferResult)` is invalid and represents an uninitialized result.
- No public factory can create partial or contradictory results.

Factory exceptions identify incorrect API usage. They are not normal gameplay control flow.

### `LootTransferFailureReason`

The stable domain reasons are:

| Reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Uninitialized` | Sentinel for a result that has not been produced. It is not a valid rejection. |
| `None` | No failure. Used only by successful validation or results. |
| `InvalidLoot` | The loot identity is invalid or has no usable domain definition. |
| `InvalidAmount` | The requested quantity is not positive. |
| `SourceNotFound` | The source entity cannot be resolved. |
| `DestinationNotFound` | The destination entity cannot be resolved. |
| `InsufficientAmount` | The source cannot provide the complete requested quantity. |
| `InventoryFull` | A gameplay slot rule prevents receiving a new distinct loot ID. |
| `OutOfRange` | The endpoints do not satisfy the gameplay distance rule. |
| `MissingAuthority` | The operation is not running under the required State Authority. |
| `ContainerUnavailable` | A resolved endpoint cannot currently participate in the operation. |
| `Overflow` | Applying the complete quantity would exceed the supported integer range. |

Catalog index failures and Fusion representation details are not public failure reasons. Integrations diagnose them locally and translate them to an appropriate stable reason, such as `InvalidLoot` or `ContainerUnavailable`.

## 9. Loot capabilities

Capabilities are intentionally independent:

| Capability | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ILootContentReader` | Produces a complete `IReadOnlyList<LootEntry>` snapshot. |
| `ILootQuantityReader` | Returns the aggregated amount for one `LootId`; invalid or absent IDs return zero. |
| `ILootSlotCapacityReader` | Exposes gameplay `SlotCapacity` and `OccupiedSlotCount`. |
| `ILootReceiver` | Prevalidates and commits reception. |
| `ILootExtractor` | Prevalidates and commits extraction. |

Reading must not expose a mutable backing collection. A caller may retain or enumerate a snapshot without gaining write access to authoritative storage.

Gameplay slots count distinct loot IDs with positive quantities. Increasing an existing ID does not consume another slot; receiving a new ID requires a free slot. There is no automatic splitting, weight capacity, or per-stack maximum in the current contract.

The `NetworkDictionary` capacity of 64 used by `PlayerLootReceiver` is a Fusion representation limit, not gameplay slot capacity. Reaching a technical representation constraint must not be reported as `InventoryFull`.

`PlayerLootReceiver` implements content reading, quantity queries, configurable gameplay slots, reception, and extraction. Its serialized slot capacity is positive, cannot exceed the `NetworkDictionary` representation limit, and is configured to 16 on the base network-player prefab. The value is local static configuration rather than replicated state.

State Authority is the only writer. Reception stacks an existing ID regardless of occupied-slot count and rejects a new ID with `InventoryFull` only when the configured gameplay capacity is full. Extraction requires the complete requested quantity, removes an entry when its remainder reaches zero, and never stores zero or negative quantities. Both successful commits increment `LootChangeSequence`, allowing Input Authority presentation to refresh from the replicated read-only snapshot.

The temporary inventory has the same lifecycle as the player's `NetworkObject`. Player despawn or runner shutdown destroys its replicated contents, local presentation queues are cleared during despawn, and a player spawned in a later session starts from an empty network collection. No loot state is persisted in static fields, services, or `ScriptableObject` assets.

## 10. Loot prevalidation and commit protocol

Reception and extraction each have two explicit phases:

```csharp
LootTransferFailureReason ValidateReceive(in LootTransferRequest request);
void CommitReceive(in LootTransferRequest request);

LootTransferFailureReason ValidateExtraction(in LootTransferRequest request);
void CommitExtraction(in LootTransferRequest request);
```

### Prevalidation

- Performs no mutation.
- Returns `None` only when the endpoint can immediately apply the complete requested amount.
- Returns a typed gameplay rejection for expected invalid conditions.
- Checks the rules owned by that endpoint, including identity, authority, loot, quantity, availability, capacity where supported, and overflow.

### Commit

- Runs only after successful prevalidation.
- Runs synchronously without yielding authoritative control, re-entry, or intervening mutation.
- Does not repeat gameplay validation.
- Does not return a rejection result.
- Applies exactly `RequestedAmount`.

If a commit cannot apply the prevalidated amount, the caller or implementation violated the protocol. That condition must be diagnosed as an integration/programming error rather than converted into a late gameplay rejection.

TASK-31 implements the player endpoint capabilities but does not implement an atomic runtime transfer between two storage endpoints. There is deliberately no `ILootTransferCoordinator` contract yet.

## 11. Authoritative pickup integration

`NetworkLootPickup` is a consumable source with its own reservation, not an `ILootExtractor` and not a storage-to-storage coordinator.

Its authoritative sequence is:

1. Validate State Authority, interaction request, range, and pickup availability.
2. Resolve the destination's `ILootReceiver` capability.
3. Build the unified `LootTransferRequest`.
4. Reserve the pickup by setting its consumed state.
5. Call `ValidateReceive`.
6. Restore the reservation on every rejection before commit.
7. Call `CommitReceive` immediately after successful validation.
8. Produce complete success and despawn only after the commit.

This ordering prevents duplicate reward delivery while preserving the pickup's existing single-consumption transaction. It is an integration between a consumable source and a receiver, not a general transfer between two inventories.

## 12. Runtime transfer work not yet implemented

A future authoritative coordinator must:

1. Resolve source and destination capabilities.
2. Validate State Authority, distance, and endpoint availability.
3. Prevalidate extraction and reception.
4. Exclude or serialize competing requests that affect the same content.
5. Define the commit order.
6. Execute both commits synchronously without re-entry or yielding control.
7. Produce the single `LootTransferResult`.

That later work also owns capability registration for extractable containers and Host/Client tests for storage-to-storage transfers. TASK-31 does not claim those guarantees.

## 13. Presentation contracts

Presentation payloads describe confirmed gameplay without owning or mutating gameplay state:

- `AttackPerformedEvent` describes a successfully executed attack for animation, audio, or VFX.
- `DamageResolvedEvent` pairs a request with its resolved damage result.
- `InteractionPresentationEvent` carries the authoritative interaction sequence and outcome to local presentation.
- `LootGrantPresentationEvent` describes the current authoritative pickup delivery and resolves visual metadata locally through the loot catalog.

Presentation events must not apply damage, commit inventory changes, spawn or despawn authoritative objects, or decide whether an interaction succeeded. Networked gameplay remains the source of truth.

`LootGrantPresentationEvent` remains specific to the current pickup flow. General transfer presentation will be designed when runtime container transfers have real consumers.

## 14. Validation expectations

Contract tests should focus on observable semantics:

- construction and derived validity
- value equality and hash consistency
- request and result invariants
- contradictory factory inputs
- independent capability implementations through stubs
- validators that do not mutate state
- commit signatures that cannot return gameplay rejection
- read-only content snapshots
- receiver and pickup integration

Architecture independence is verified through actual dependencies, imports, public types, and diff review. Tests must not infer architecture by searching for concrete class names such as `Player`, `Chest`, or `EnemyCorpse`.

Host/Client transfer coordination, distance, availability, commit ordering, and concurrency tests remain pending until a runtime coordinator exists.
