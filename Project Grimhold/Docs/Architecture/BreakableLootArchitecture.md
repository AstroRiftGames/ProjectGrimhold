# Breakable Loot Architecture

## Context and decision

Breakable world obstacles are authoritative network entities spawned from scene
points. They receive the same `DamageRequest` used by character combat and release
ordinary `NetworkLootPickup` objects directly into the world. A destroyed
breakable is never inspectable and never becomes a loot container.

Random content reuses `LootContainerContentTable`,
`LootContainerContentTableValidation`, `LootContainerContentRoller` and
`LootDefinitionCatalog`. This keeps one catalog identity and one weighted-roll
implementation for containers and world drops.

## Responsibilities and data flow

```text
NetworkSpawnSceneConfiguration (Breakables points and amount)
  -> NetworkSpawnManager (State Authority)
  -> validate table/catalog/prefabs and derive group-scoped seed
  -> roll LootEntry values
  -> Runner.Spawn(BreakableObject, OnBeforeSpawned)
  -> BreakableObject retains the authoritative roll locally

DamageRequest
  -> DamageResolver
  -> BreakableObject.ApplyDamage
  -> IsDestroyed = true before any side effect
  -> disable/unregister damage and blocking colliders
  -> Runner.Spawn(NetworkLootPickup, OnBeforeSpawned) per rolled stack
  -> pickup replicates catalog index and quantity
  -> existing interaction and inventory transfer flow
```

## Sources of truth and ownership

- `BreakableObject.Health` and `IsDestroyed` are networked simulation state.
- State Authority alone applies damage, confirms destruction and spawns pickups.
- The content table, catalog, pickup prefab and local offsets are immutable prefab configuration.
- The rolled `LootEntry[]` exists only on the authoritative breakable until destruction. Proxies never receive a seed and never roll.
- Each spawned pickup owns the replicated catalog index, quantity and consumed state. Static display data is resolved locally from the shared catalog.
- `IsDestroyed` is committed before pickup spawning and is the one-shot guard against simultaneous or repeated damage.

## Boundaries and failure policy

`BreakableObject` implements only `IDamageable`; it does not implement
`IInteractable`, `ILootExtractor`, `ILootQuantityReader`, or contain
`NetworkLootContainer`. Presentation observes replicated destruction and never
changes gameplay state.

Invalid prefab, catalog, table, capacity or pre-spawn initialization skips the
affected breakable spawn. An invalid returned network object is immediately
despawned. Runtime pickup initialization failure is logged and the invalid pickup
is despawned; destruction is not rolled back or retried.

## Scene authoring

Add a `SpawnGroupType.Breakables` entry to the scene's
`NetworkSpawnSceneConfiguration`, assign unique points and set `Amount` no higher
than the point count. Assign `BreakableObject.prefab` to the scene-owned
`NetworkSpawnManager`. The current `Gameplay` scene intentionally has no
Breakables group or points.

The prefab uses a Character-layer trigger for combat targeting and a separate
WorldCollision-layer solid collider for movement blocking. Both are disabled
after destruction.

## Validation

- EditMode validates group dispatch, seed-domain separation, prefab composition, table/catalog compatibility and point idempotence.
- PlayMode validates partial damage, fatal damage, repeated hits, collider and renderer removal, and unique pickup generation.
- Manual Host/Client validation must confirm replicated destruction, identical pickups, collection, and late joining.
